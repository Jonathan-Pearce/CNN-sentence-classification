# Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification

## Jonathan Pearce, Matthew Etchells and Brendon Keirle - McGill University

### Comp 551 Applied Machine Learning, Final Project (Winter 2019)

Sentence  classification  is  concerned  with  avariety  of  tasks  in  natural  language  processing,  includingthe  prediction  of  opinion  in  text.  In  the  past  standardsupervised learning models such as Naive Bayes, SupportVector  Machine  and  Logistic  Regression.  In  recent  yearsthere  has  been  a  shift  towards  the  use  of  deep  learningapproaches  to  these  tasks.  In  this  project  we  look  at  apublication  by  Yoon  Kim  outlining  the  use  of  CNNs  forsentence  classification  tasks  across  several  datasets.  Kimuses  a  baseline  model  of  a  simple  CNN  for  comparisonwith  the  more  complex  approaches  proposed.  It  may  beimportant  to  compare  novel  deep  learning  approaches  tobaselines  that  use  standard  supervised  learning  models.We  look  at  the  extension  of  standard  supervised  learningmodels to these same datasets, and found that these modelscan  consistently  outperform  the  simple  CNN  baseline.
